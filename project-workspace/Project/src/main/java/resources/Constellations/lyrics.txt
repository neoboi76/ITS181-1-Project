Into the night
You would do anything to be...
Around me

No more regrets
No hiding behind closed doors at sunset...

Drive into the twilight
Moonlight, silver life
Waiting for the sunrise
Hope that grows inside
You don't have to try...

Into the night
You could go anywhere but still...
Rather take that girl

Tripping again
Too many flashbacks from the old friends...

Drive into the twilight
Moonlight, silver life
Waiting for the sunrise
Hope that grows inside
Back into the night...

The constellation calling out to stations
Keep your eyes open wide

Back into the love...
Hear the sirens recalling in silence

Be mine
Be mine
Be mine
You don't have to try...

Back into the night...
The constellation calling out to stations
Keep your eyes open wide

Back into the love...
Hear the sirens recalling in silence

Be mine
Be mine
Be mine
You don't have to try...
